# ast-builder

Build your Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) directly by writing code.
Simply type in your code and get the right [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) api to build your AST.

Read the [introductory blog post](http://hangaroundtheweb.com/2019/12/ast-builder-building-ast-nodes-from-code/) to know more about the tool.

This application is built in [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/)

## Motivation
The reason this project is created is because, I am simply frustrated for looking up reference for writing codemods and the jscodeshift api is not very well documented.

This is an interactive version of [jscodeshift-docs](https://github.com/rajasegar/jscodeshift-docs)
